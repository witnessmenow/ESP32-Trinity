## Help Support what I do!

My main contribution to the open source community to date has been my Arduino libraries for the ESP32 and ESP8266, but I have recently been trying to contribute more certified open source hardware projects, and they are a lot of work!

## Additional Hardware Required

To use the Trinity you will need the following additional things

  - 64x32 P3 Matrix display - [Aliexpress\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_dYz5DLt)
  - 64x64 P3 Matrix display - [Aliexpress\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_BfjY0wfp)
- A power supply, you can either use a barrel jack or USB-C (USB-C is limited to by a poly fuse)
  - [5V 8A laptop style power supply\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_d7uVLXt) - How much power the display uses varies based on how many LEDs are on, but this should cover you for anything you want to draw.
