## Help Support what I do!

My main contribution to the open source community to date has been my Arduino libraries for the ESP32 and ESP8266, but I recently been trying to contribute more certified open source hardware projects, and they are a lot of work!

## Where To Buy?

My Tindie store is closed indefinitely (for more information you can check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ2qgSj0Ets)). I will more than likely open it for a short run of trinitys some time in the futue, but I do not have any more details right now.

The Trinity is still available through these resellers (FYI, this current batch is probably all that there will be as there is no plans to restock them):

- [Makerfabs](https://www.makerfabs.com/esp32-trinity.html) (Ships from China) - Available here at a reduced price. Makerfabs also sell the panels that have been tested with the Trinity.
- [Unexpected Maker](https://unexpectedmaker.com/shop/esp32-trinity) (Ships from Australia)
- [Colin Hickey](https://store.eplop.co.uk/product/esp32_trinity/) (Ships from UK)

All Trinity's arrive assembled and have been fully tested.

If you are interested in the Trinity and one of the reseller options suits better please do purchase from there, it being successful for resellers works out well for me too!

## Additional Hardware Required

To use the Trinity you will need the following additional things

- RGB LED Matrix. Please note that I can not guarantee the following displays will definitely work with the library/board, They are ones I have bought in the past and work, but sellers have changed stock before.
  - 64x32 P3 Matrix display - [Aliexpress\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_dYz5DLt)
  - 64x64 P3 Matrix display - [Aliexpress\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_BfjY0wfp)
- A power supply, you can either use a barrel jack or USB-C (USB-C is limited to by a poly fuse)
  - [5V 8A laptop style power supply\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_d7uVLXt) - How much power the display uses varies based on how many LEDs are on, but this should cover you for anything you want to draw.
  - Any USB-C Power supply
