Info, examples, instructions and hardware files for the ESP32 Trinity, an open source ESP32 board for controlling HUB75 matrix panels.

## Help Support what I do!

My main contribution to the open source community to date has been my Arduino libraries for the ESP32 and ESP8266, but I recently been trying to contribute more certified open source hardware projects, and they are a lot of work!
